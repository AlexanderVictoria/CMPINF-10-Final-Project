<p>This project analyzes data on air quality, fire reports, and drug overdoses in the Pittsburgh area to identify the best neighborhoods. By performing data analysis and visualization, we aim to provide insights that can help residents, policymakers, and community stakeholders make informed decisions.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This project evaluates neighborhoods in the general Pittsburgh area by analyzing three key datasets:</p>

* Air Quality Data: Identifies pollution levels and overall environmental quality.
*   Fire Report Data: Highlights the frequency and severity of fire incidents in neighborhoods.
*    Drug Overdose Data: Provides insights into public health and safety concerns related to substance abuse.

<p>The goal is to combine these metrics to determine the most desirable neighborhoods in Pittsburgh based on safety, health, and environmental quality.</p>
