<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This project evaluates neighborhoods in the general Pittsburgh area by analyzing three key datasets:</p>

* [Air Quality Data](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-fatal-accidental-overdoses): Identifies pollution levels and overall environmental quality.
*   [Fire Report Data](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/fire-incidents-in-city-of-pittsburgh): Highlights the frequency and severity of fire incidents in neighborhoods.
*    [Drug Overdose Data](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-air-quality): Provides insights into public health and safety concerns related to substance abuse.

<p>The goal is to combine these metrics to determine the most desirable neighborhoods in Pittsburgh based on safety, health, and environmental quality.</p>

<p>Each submetric dataset has been uploaded to the repository with a seperate notebook where analysis was done that are combined together in the "[Final-Report.ipynb](https://github.com/AlexanderVictoria/CMPINF-10-Final-Project/blob/main/Final-Report.ipynb)" file</p>
